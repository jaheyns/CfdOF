# CfdOF Development Roadmap

This is a (non-exhaustive) list of tasks which are planned or needed. If you would like to make a contribution,
please consider tackling one of these items.

## General

* Add translations
    * See the guide here: https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Translating_an_external_workbench
    * Forum topic: https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=36413
* Visualisation of point locations. At various places a point is specified - e.g. an internal 
mesh point when snappyHexMesh is selected in the meshing task panel, as well as
when specifying the scalar transport sources in the scalar transport panel. These should be 
displayed as a point on the model so that the user has feedback on their location. 
* Logging - some of the more technical/diagnostic output that is printed to the report view 
could instead be directed to the log, so that the report view is cleaner and more readable 
for the user. Generally improve the logging and messages that are printed there.
(see FreeCAD.Console.PrintLog/PrintMessage/PrintWarning/PrintError.)
* Test and provide more elegant errors or fallbacks for invalid/unexpected/unusual sequences of actions,
e.g. (there are many more!):
    * Switching a case to/from incompressible and compressible and trying to write it without
    re-setting the material properties to a valid type
* Test and fix running under WSL on Windows
  
## Meshing
* Add ability to import meshes from other formats? (CGNS, .msh (fluent), others?)
* Expose parallel option in GUI

## Solver
* Add a mechanism to specify surface tension coefficients between each pair of fluids
  (with future extensibility to other pairwise interfacial properties).
* Add cyclic boundary conditions
* Add ability to import / export existing OF cases / results
* Improve organisation of source code
* Improve edge detection for meshing?
* Expose parallel run option in GUI

## Documentation
* Formal documentation should be added to FreeCAD Wiki.

## Testing
* More 'demo' cases are needed, which are specified as macros and run during the testing runs
  * Cases with postprocessing
  * Buoyant case(s)
* Additional unit tests which also test the functionality of the task panels, are needed. Currently testing is only
  done based on macros. Somehow, interaction with the GUI itself needs to be simulated.

## Future-scheduled tasks
* On release of FreeCAD v0.21, stop supporting FreeCAD <= 0.19
    * Remove metadata.txt
    * Remove legacy python 2 code and python2/3 switches
    * Switch repository in Addon manager to gitlab
    * Remove backward-compatible plot code in compat/
    * Update version requirement in package.xml and dependency checker
