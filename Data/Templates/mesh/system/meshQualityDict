//  the cell centre. Set to very negative number (e.g. -1E30) to

//- Minimum normalised cell determinant. This is the determinant of all
//  the areas of internal faces. It is a measure of how much of the
//  outside area of the cell is to other cells. The idea is that if all
//  outside faces of the cell are 'floating' (zeroGradient) the
//  'fixedness' of the cell is determined by the area of the internal faces.
