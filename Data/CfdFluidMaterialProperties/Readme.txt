This is the FreeCAD fluid material library. It's intended to gather
the most common fluid properties.

Please verify the fluid material properties before use. It aims to
serve as a convenience and does not aim to be a comprehensive
reference.

Each material has a Type keyword identifying the kind of modelling
it is compatible with. Only those compatible with the physics model
selected will be shown in the GUI:
- Isothermal: Denotes properties at fixed temperature and pressure,
for use in incompressible, isothermal solvers
- Incompressible: Properties modelled as dependent on temperature but
not pressure, useful for using very nearly incompressible fluids with
the low-Mach compressible solver.
- Compressible: Properties dependent on both temperature and pressure.

Current values are taken from FM White (2011) Fluid Mechanics.
