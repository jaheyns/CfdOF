# Computional fluid dynamics (CFD) workbench for FreeCAD

This workbench aims to help users set up and run CFD analysis. It guides the user in selecting the relevant physics, 
specifying the material properties, generating a mesh, assigning boundary conditions and setting the solver settings
before running the simulation. Where possible best practices are included to improve the stability of the solvers.

This software is a fork of the CFD workbench developed by [Qingfeng Xia](http://github.com/qingfengxia/Cfd), but
focuses on assisting new CFD users. It therefore places greater emphasis on usability and solver stability instead of
functionality.

## Features

### Current:

* Incompressible, laminar flow (simpleFoam).
* Basic material data base.
* Flow initialisation with a potential solver.
* Tetrahedral meshing using GMSH including multiple region meshing using FEM workbench functionality.
* Post processing using paraview.
* Porous regions and porous baffles.
* Runs on Windows 7-10
* Unit testing

### Future (2017):

* Cut-cell Cartesian meshing with boundary layers.
* Extension to turbulent using RANS (k-w SST).
* Conjugate heat transfer.

### Platforms supported

#### Linux: 

Any system on which FreeCAD and the prerequisites listed below can be installed. The following have been tested:
* Ubuntu 16.04 
* Fedora 24

#### Windows:

* Windows 7 (tested)
* Windows 8 (not yet tested)
* Windows 10 (tested)

#### MacOSX:

Not tested, but a POSIX system. Possible to install and run OpenFOAM. 
      
=============================================
  
## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- [Latest development version of FreeCAD (0.17 prerelease; git commit 10432 or greater)](https://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/Download)  
- [OpenFOAM (version 3.0.1 or later)](http://openfoam.org/download/)  
- [PyFoam (version 0.6.6 or later)](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyFoam)  
- [Gnuplot.py (version 1.8)](http://gnuplot-py.sourceforge.net/)  
- [Paraview](http://www.paraview.org/)  
- [GMSH (version 2.13 or later)](http://gmsh.info/)  


### Setting up CFD workbench

#### Windows

In Windows, it is suggested to download a pre-packaged version from 
https://opensimsa.github.io/download.html
and consult the included README file. This package comes with PyFoam and Gnuplot.py already installed into the bundled version of Python, and GMSH 
included. The OpenFOAM installation is via the [blueCFD](http://bluecfd.github.io/Core/Downloads/) package.

#### Linux

As the CFD workbench is fully developed in Python the user is not required to compile any libraries and can directly 
copy the folder to <FreeCAD-directory>/Mod/CfdFoam or to ~/.FreeCAD/Mod/CfdFoam (in Linux) or \<Application Data\>\FreeCAD\Mod\CfdFoam (in Windows). 

As an example, from the command line, clone the CFD workbench
    
    $ git clone https://github.com/jaheyns/CfdFoam.git
        
and create a symbolic link to the local FreeCAD instalation directory. 
    
    $ ln -s <path/to/CfdFoam>  <path/to/FreeCAD>/Mod/CfdFoam
        

This fork is unfortunately not yet available under the  FreeCAD-Addon-Installer.


## Feedback

### Submitting Bugs

Please discuss issues on the [CFDFoam dedicated FreeCAD forum thread](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=21576).

## Developement

It is asked that developers should only add functionality or code that is working and can be tested. Dead code, even
portions included for possible future functionality, reduces function clarity and increases the maintenance overhead.

### Testing

Unit testing is currently under development. Where possible, it is asked that all new functionality should be included
in the unit test framework.


### Style guide

For consistency please follow [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
1. Use 4 spaces per indentation level (spaces are preferred over tabs).
2. Limit all lines to a maximum of 120 characters.
3. Break lines before binary operators.
4. Blank lines 
    
    - Surround top-level function and class definitions with two lines.

    - Definitions inside a class are surrounded by a single line.
    
5. Imports should usually be on separate lines.
6. Comments

    - Docstrings always use """triple double-quotes"""
    
    - Block comment starts with a # and a single space and are indented to the same level as that code
    
    - Use inline comments sparingly. They are on the same line as a statement and should be separated by at least two
 spaces from the statement. 

7. Avoid trailing whitespaces
8. Naming convention

    - ClassNames (Camel)
    - variable_names_without_capitals (Underscore)
    - CONSTANTS_USE_CAPITALS (Uppercase)
    - functionsWithoutCapitals (Camel instead of underscore to ensure consistency with FreeCAD)
    - __class_attribute (Double leading underscore)
