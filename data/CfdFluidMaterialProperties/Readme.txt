This is the FreeCAD fluid material library. It's intended to gather
the most common fluid properties.

Edit:
Please verify the fluid material properties before use. It aims to
serve as a quick reference and does not aim to be an extended look
up table.

To prevent the database from becomming inefficiently large it is only
limited to commonly used variables at 20 degrees Celcius at 1 atm.

Current values are taken from FM White (2011) Fluid Mechanics.
